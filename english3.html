Smoke testing, also known as build verification testing,
this  is a type of software testing that is performed to quickly assess the stability of a newly developed or updated software build. 
The primary purpose of smoke testing is to determine if the essential and critical functionalities of the software are working as expected,
 ensuring that the application is at least in a "smokable" or usable state for further,
  more comprehensive testing.
Here are the key characteristics and objectives of smoke testing:
Basic Functionality: Smoke tests focus on testing the fundamental and core functionalities of the software.
 These functionalities are often essential for the application to function properly.
Quick Assessment: Smoke testing is usually quick and lightweight, 
aiming to provide a rapid assessment of the software's stability. 
It is typically executed shortly after a new build is created.
Pass or Fail-> The outcome of smoke testing is binary:
 either the software passes (meaning the critical functionalities work as expected) or ,
 it fails (indicating that there are significant issues that need to be addressed before further testing).
 Early Detection: Smoke testing helps catch critical issues early in the development process,
  allowing developers to address them before more extensive testing efforts,
   such as regression testing or integration testing, are performed.
Automated or Manual->Smoke tests can be automated using test scripts or performed manually by testers,
 depending on the project's requirements and available resources.
Regression Testing->the smoke test suite may be integrated into the regression testing suite to ensure that basic functionality remains intact as the software evolves.
Smoke testing is particularly useful in Agile and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) environments, 
where software builds are frequent, and it's essential to quickly identify showstopper issues,
 that could prevent further testing or deployment.

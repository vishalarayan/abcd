After India gained independence in 1947, the region continued to be part of Bihar.
 the demand for a separate state for the tribal communities of Chotanagpur and Santhal Pargana grew.
The Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) and other regional political parties played a pivotal role in the demand for a separate state.
On November 15, 2000, Jharkhand was carved out of Bihar as the 28th state of India, with Ranchi as its capital.
Jharkhand is known for its diverse tribal cultures and languages. The state has a significant tribal population, including Santhals, Mundas, Oraons, and others.
The state is rich in mineral resources and is a major contributor to India's and economc growth. 
It is known for its coal, iron ore, and steel industries.
 Despite its economic potential, Jharkhand faces challenges related to poverty, underdevelopment,
 and issues concerning land rights and displacement of tribal communities.
 Jharkhand has witnessed a dynamic political landscape with multiple parties vying for power. The Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM), Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP),
 and Indian National Congress (INC) have been key players in the state's politics.
Jharkhand's history is a reflection of India's diverse cultural and political landscape, 
 a blend of tribal traditions, colonial history, and the struggle for self-identity and development. The state continues to face both opportunities and challenges as it strives for progress and the well-being of its people.

Narendra Modi is an Indian politician who served as the Prime Minister of India 
from May 2014 to my last knowledge update in September 2021.
 He is a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS),
  which are right-wing political and cultural organizations in India.
Modi was born on September 17, 1950, in Vadnagar, Gujarat, India.
 Before becoming the Prime Minister, he served as the Chief Minister of the Indian state of Gujarat from 2001 to 2014. 
  His tenure as the Prime Minister was marked by various economic and social initiatives,
 such as "Make in India," "Swachh Bharat Abhiyan" (Clean India Campaign), and "Digital India."
Modi's leadership has been a subject of both praise and criticism,
 with his supporters pointing to his economic reforms and infrastructure development projects,
  while his critics have raised concerns about issues like religious tensions and freedom of expression in India.
Please note that my knowledge is based on information available up to September 2021, 
and there may have been developments or changes since then.
